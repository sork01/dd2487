IDs:
  By default IDs are strings containing only a number, e.g. "23", which signifies the number automatically generated for them.
  You are also able to assign your own ids, such as "m1". Please notice that if you define a minion id such as "m11" it will have the same priorities as the
  automatically generated id "11". Using higher values will make this a non-issue.
valid-targets:
  Is checked whenever a minion, spell or weapon is played.
    If not present in the card definition, no target is required.

    If present it should be a function that takes the state and the player who is about to play the card
      If it returns nil, no target is valid, but the card can still be played (like when no 7 attack minion is present for big game hunter)
      If it returns a list of ids, the target-id of the played card MUST be in the list (if a 7 attack minion exists and big game hunter is played, it MUST target at least one of them.)


Gotcha's:
  Changing the order of definitions can break tests that depend on randomness.
    Example: Say the map entry for "Ancient Watcher" is located below the the entry for "Imp".
             Moving the "Ancient Watcher" up above the "Imp" may cause a random choice of minion
             to become different even if the seed used in the test is unchanged.
